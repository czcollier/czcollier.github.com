### EDUCATION

#### Ph.D. Research May 2004-May 2005 - Tufts University, Medford, MA 
   Examined lower bounding measures and other techniques for speeding
   computation of Dynamic Time Warping and other distance measures traditionally
   used for time series comparison. Applied discovered techniques to string
   similarity searches, for application in computational biology and textual
   analysis/text search problems. 

####  Master of Science in Computer Science May 2004, GPA 3.67 - Tufts

#####  Thesis Project: Artificial Nose 
  Developed software to identify and classify airborne compounds given time-series
  data from an optical array based olfactory sensor. Employed statistical machine
  learning methods. Studied accuracy of these varied techniques to determine the
  optimal approach for given classification situations. 

####  Other Projects: 
##### Application of the RAMBO Memory Architecture to Approximate K-Nearest Neighbor Search Solutions for High Dimensions - Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Advanced Data Structures - Spring 2003
  Two schemes are presented for applying a byte-overlapped memory
  architecture to approximate solutions to the K-Nearest Neighbors problem
  to provide very good performance, the fastest of which has a query time of
  O(d + k), for k points reported in d dimensional space.
##### Random Bit Generation Using Atmospheric Radio Propagation Phenomena - Tufts University, Cryptography and Security - Fall 2002 
  Long-distance radio propagation phenomena are a possible source of
  naturally-occurring entropy, and may be used to produce random numbers of
  good quality. In this study, this method was used to generate streams of
  bits which where then subject to several statistical tests for true
  randomness. Variations in a distantly transmitted, sky-wave propagated
  signal were used to successfully generate the random bits.

### Tufts University, Medford, MA - Certificate May 2002 
#### Post-Baccalaureate Minor in Computer Science 

### Connecticut College, New London, CT - B.A. May 1997 
#### Architectural Studies major, concentration in Design Studies
