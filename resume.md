## EDUCATION

### Tufts University, Medford, MA 
   Ph.D. Research May 2004-May 2005 
   Examined lower bounding measures and other techniques for speeding
   computation of Dynamic Time Warping and other distance measures traditionally
   used for time series comparison. Applied discovered techniques to string
   similarity searches, for application in computational biology and textual
   analysis/text search problems. 

### Tufts University, Medford, MA 
####   Master of Science in Computer Science May 2004, GPA 3.67 

####  Thesis Project: Artificial Nose 
  Developed software to identify and classify airborne compounds given time-series
  data from an optical array based olfactory sensor. Employed statistical machine
  learning methods. Studied accuracy of these varied techniques to determine the
  optimal approach for given classification situations. 

###  Other Projects: 
    * Application of the RAMBO Memory Architecture to Approximate K-Nearest Neighbor
      Search Solutions for High Dimensions
      Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Advanced Data Structures - Spring 2003 
      Two schemes are presented for applying a byte-overlapped memory
      architecture to approximate solutions to the K-Nearest Neighbors problem
      to provide very good performance, the fastest of which has a query time of
      O(d + k), for k points reported in d dimensional space.
      
    * Random Bit Generation Using Atmospheric Radio Propagation Phenomena 
      Tufts University, Cryptography and Security - Fall 2002 
      Long-distance radio propagation phenomena are a possible source of
      naturally-occurring entropy, and may be used to produce random numbers of
      good quality. In this study, this method was used to generate streams of
      bits which where then subject to several statistical tests for true
      randomness. Variations in a distantly transmitted, sky-wave propagated
      signal were used to successfully generate the random bits.

 * Tufts University, Medford, MA - Certificate May 2002 
   Post-Baccalaureate Minor in Computer Science 

 * Connecticut College, New London, CT - B.A. May 1997 
   Architectural Studies major, concentration in Design Studies
